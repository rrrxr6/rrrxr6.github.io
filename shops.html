<h1>Best Donut Shops</h1>
<p>
    These rankings give an idea of how each donut shop stacks up against the others. They are subjective and will likely evolve over time. Donuts shops within a tier are all pretty similar. For example, even though Fluffy Fresh, Lamar's, and Walmart Bakery are all adjacent in the rankings there is a much bigger gap between Fluffy Fresh and Lamar's than there is between Lamar's and Walmart Bakery.

<h2>Tier Explanations</h2>
<b>Great</b> - The best of the best. I would go out of my way to grab a donut from these places. Little to nothing to complain about.
<br><br>
<b>Good</b> - I would happily buy a donut from any of these places if I were in the mood and a location was nearby. Good donuts but not worth inconveniencing myself. These shops often do at least one thing great, but just are not great across the board.
<br><br>
<b>Okay</b> - Average donuts. If a coworker brought these in to the office I would still eat them. Not bad, but probably not donut shops I would go back to given the many other superior options.
<br><br>
<b>Poor</b> - Donuts that I did not finish eating. Would not go back and might actively discourage others from visiting.
<br><br>
<b>Upcoming</b> - Places that I've heard of or that were recommended to me that I have yet to try.
